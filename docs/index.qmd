_maidr: Inclusive Data Science for All
</div>

Are you blind or visually impaired person who wants to independently create and explore data visualizations by yourself? Are you a sighted person who wants to make your data visualizations more accessible to everyone? If so, **maidr** is for you!

**maidr** (pronounced as 'mader') is an accessible framework for multimodal data representation. With maidr, blind and sighted users can easily augment data visualizations into _touchable_ (Braille), _readable_ (text), _audible_ (sonification), and _conversational_ (AI) formats.

The following summarizes the key features and design principles of maidr:

1. Accessibility: maidr is designed to be accessible to both blind and sighted users from the ground up. Beyond the passive consumption level, blind users can also independently create, modify, and share data visualizations with others.

2. Inclusivity: maidr does not pursue a special version for blind users. Instead, it provides a unified interface that supports both visual and non-visual data exploration. This way, blind and sighted users can work together on the same data science projects.

3. Integration: maidr seamlessly integrates with the popular and mainstream data science environments  (e.g., Python, pandas, and NumPy) as well as data visualization libraries in Python like **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

4. Unintrusiveness: maidr does not require changes to existing core data visualization code. Without needing to reconstruct an accessible version separately, you can just `import maidr` package and use `maidr.show()` to your plots. Blind and sighted users can use and share the same visualization codebase in their shared data science projects.

5. Synchronization: maidr treats visualization as one of the multimodal data representations and ensures that all representations (e.g., visual, tactile, textual, audible) cursor and braille routing key positions are synchronized across different modalities.

6. Reactivity: maidr supports widely adopted reactive and interactive computing including Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter Labs, Google Colab, Streamlit dashboard, and Shiny dashboard. maidr also supports interactive computing inside code editors, such as Visual Studio Code.

7. Reproducibility: maidr supports the generation of accessible data visualizations as part of the reproducible data science workflow with Quarto scientific publishing system. You can easily create accessible data representations within your reproducible reports, website blogs, slides, e-books, dashboards, and more.

8. Scalability: maidr supports a wide range of data visualization types, including bar plots, histograms, line plots, box plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, and more. maidr is designed to be extensible to support new visualization types.

Our core philosophy is to make data representation accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to explore and understand data, and that accessibility should be a core part of the data science process.

## Let's Install

The installation really couldn't be much easier. Use this:

```{.bash}
# install the latest release from PyPI
pip install -U maidr
```

```{.bash}
# or install the development version from GitHub
pip install -U git+https://github.com/xability/py_maidr.git
```


## LLM Configuration for Interactive Shell

To use OpenAI or Gemini Models along with the maidr library, follow the steps below:

1. Signup and get the API Keys for OpenAI or Gemini Models.
2. Add the keys to environment variables so that python binder can access the keys.
   (Note: This only temporarily adds keys in environment variable, for persistent access you might want to add the export command to your shell configuration)

##### Mac Configuration

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<< add you key here >>"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="<< add you key here >>"
```

##### Windows Configuration

```
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "<< add you key here >>"
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "<< add you key here >>"
```


## Examples


### Bar Plot

# | warning: false
# | fig-alt: Bar plot showing the average body mass of penguins by species

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import maidr
import seaborn as sns


# Turn off interactive mode globally
plt.ioff()


# Load the penguins dataset
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")

# Create a bar plot showing the average body mass of penguins by species
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
b_plot = sns.barplot(
    x="species", y="body_mass_g", data=penguins, errorbar="sd", palette="Blues_d"
)
plt.title("Average Body Mass of Penguins by Species")
plt.xlabel("Species")
plt.ylabel("Body Mass (g)")

petal_lengths = iris["petal_length"]

# Plot a histogram of the petal lengths
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
hist_plot = sns.histplot(petal_lengths, kde=True, color="blue", binwidth=0.5)

plt.title("Petal Lengths in Iris Dataset")
plt.xlabel("Petal Length (cm)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")

# plt.show()
maidr.show(hist_plot)
```


### Line Plot

```{python}
# | fig-alt: Line plot of tips vs total bill for Thursday

# Load the 'tips' dataset from seaborn
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Choose a specific subset of the dataset (e.g., data for 'Thursday')
subset_data = tips[tips["day"] == "Thur"]

# Create a line plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
line_plot = sns.lineplot(
    data=subset_data,
    x="total_bill",
    y="tip",
    markers=True,
    style="day",
    legend=False,
)
plt.title("Tips vs Total Bill (Thursday)")
plt.xlabel("Total Bill")
plt.ylabel("Tip")

# plt.show()
maidr.show(line_plot)
```


### Heat Map

```{python}
# Load an example dataset from seaborn
glue = sns.load_dataset("glue").pivot(index="Model", columns="Task", values="Score")

# Plot a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
heatmap = sns.heatmap(glue, annot=True, fill_label="Score")
plt.title("Model Scores by Task")

# Show the plot
# plt.show()
maidr.show(heatmap)
```


### Scatter Plot

```{python}
# Create a scatter plot
scatter_plot = sns.scatterplot(
    data=iris, x="sepal_length", y="sepal_width", hue="species"
)

# Adding title and labels (optional)
plt.title("Iris Sepal Length vs Sepal Width")
plt.xlabel("Sepal Length")
plt.ylabel("Sepal Width")

# Show the plot
# plt.show()
maidr.show(scatter_plot)
```

## A Basic Table using **Great Tables**

Let’s use a subset of the `islands` dataset available within `great_tables.data`:

```{python}
from great_tables import GT, md, html
from great_tables.data import islands

islands_mini = islands.head(10)
```

The `islands` data is a simple **Pandas** DataFrame with 2 columns and that'll serve as a great start. Speaking of which, the main entry point into the **Great Tables** API is the `GT` class. Let's use that to make a presentable table:

```{python}
# Create a display table showing ten of the largest islands in the world
gt_tbl = GT(islands_mini)

# Show the output table
gt_tbl
```

That doesn't look too bad! Sure, it's basic but we really didn't really ask for much. We did receive a proper table with column labels and the data. Oftentimes however, you'll want a bit more: a **Table header**, a **Stub**, and sometimes *source notes* in the **Table Footer** component.

## **Polars** DataFrame support

`GT` accepts both **Pandas** and **Polars** DataFrames. You can pass a **Polars** DataFrame to `GT`, or use its `DataFrame.style` property.

```python
import polars as pl

df_polars = pl.from_pandas(islands_mini)

# Approach 1: call GT ----
GT(df_polars)

# Approach 2: Polars style property ----
df_polars.style
```

:::{.callout-note}
The `polars.DataFrame.style` property is currently considered [unstable](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/dataframe/style.html#polars.DataFrame.style), and may change in the future. Using `GT` on a **Polars** DataFrame will always work.

## Some Beautiful Examples

In the following pages we'll use **Great Tables** to turn DataFrames into beautiful tables, like the ones below.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show the Code

from great_tables import GT, md, html
from great_tables.data import islands

islands_mini = islands.head(10)

(
    GT(islands_mini, rowname_col = "name")
    .tab_header(
        title="Large Landmasses of the World",
        subtitle="The top ten largest are presented"
    )
    .tab_source_note(
        source_note="Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975, page 406."
    )
    .tab_source_note(
        source_note=md("Reference: McNeil, D. R. (1977) *Interactive Data Analysis*. Wiley.")
    )
    .tab_stubhead(label="landmass")
)
```

```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: Show the Code

from great_tables import GT, html
from great_tables.data import airquality

airquality_m = airquality.head(10).assign(Year=1973)

gt_airquality = (
    GT(airquality_m)
    .tab_header(
        title="New York Air Quality Measurements",
        subtitle="Daily measurements in New York City (May 1-10, 1973)",
    )
    .tab_spanner(label="Time", columns=["Year", "Month", "Day"])
    .tab_spanner(label="Measurement", columns=["Ozone", "Solar_R", "Wind", "Temp"])
    .cols_move_to_start(columns=["Year", "Month", "Day"])
    .cols_label(
        Ozone=html("Ozone,<br>ppbV"),
        Solar_R=html("Solar R.,<br>cal/m<sup>2</sup>"),
        Wind=html("Wind,<br>mph"),
        Temp=html("Temp,<br>&deg;F"),
    )
)

gt_airquality
```
