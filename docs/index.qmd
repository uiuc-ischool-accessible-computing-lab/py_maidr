_maidr: Data Insight for All_
</div>

Are you eager to uncover new insights from data science but frustrated by visual-only data representations? Do you want to make your data visualizations accessible to everyone, including those who are blind or low-vision? If so, **maidr** is for you!

**maidr** (pronounced as 'mader') is an accessible framework for multimodal data representation. With maidr, blind and sighted users can easily augment data visualizations into _touchable_ (Braille), _readable_ (text), _audible_ (sonification), and _conversational_ (AI) formats.

The following summarizes the key features and design principles of maidr:

1. Accessibility: maidr is designed to be accessible to both blind and sighted users from the ground up. Beyond the passive consumption level, blind users can also independently create, modify, and share data visualizations with others.

2. Inclusivity: maidr does not pursue a special version for blind users. Instead, it provides a unified interface that supports both visual and non-visual data exploration. This way, blind and sighted users can work together on the same data science projects.

3. Integration: maidr seamlessly integrates with the popular and mainstream data science environments  (e.g., Python, pandas, and NumPy) as well as data visualization libraries in Python like **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

4. Unintrusiveness: maidr does not require changes to existing core data visualization code. Without needing to reconstruct an accessible version separately, you can just `import maidr` package and use `maidr.show()` to your plots. Blind and sighted users can use and share the same visualization codebase in their shared data science projects.

5. Synchronization: maidr treats visualization as one of the multimodal data representations and ensures that all representations (e.g., visual, tactile, textual, audible) cursor and braille routing key positions are synchronized across different modalities.

6. Reactivity: maidr supports widely adopted reactive and interactive computing including Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter Labs, Google Colab, Streamlit dashboard, and Shiny dashboard. maidr also supports interactive computing inside code editors, such as Visual Studio Code.

7. Reproducibility: maidr supports the generation of accessible data visualizations as part of the reproducible data science workflow with Quarto scientific publishing system. You can easily create accessible data representations within your reproducible reports, website blogs, slides, e-books, dashboards, and more.

8. Scalability: maidr supports a wide range of data visualization types, including bar plots, histograms, line plots, box plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, and more. maidr is designed to be extensible to support new visualization types. [Multi-figure and multi-layer visualizations are underway to support complex data visualizations.]

Our core philosophy is to make data science accessible to everyone, regardless of their visual dis/abilities. We believe that by making data visualizations accessible, we can empower blind and sighted users to work together on data science projects, share insights, and make data-driven decisions collaboratively.

## Installation

[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required to use **maidr**. After installing Python, you can install **maidr** using the following commands in your terminal:

```{.bash}
# install the latest release from PyPI
pip install -U maidr
```

```{.bash}
# or install the development version from GitHub
pip install -U git+https://github.com/xability/py-maidr.git
```

## Getting Started

Making accessible data representation with **maidr** is easy and straightforward. If you already have data visualization code using **matplotlib** or **seaborn**, you can make your plots accessible with **maidr** in just a few lines of code.

Simply import the `maidr` package and use the `maidr.show()` function to display your plots. **maidr** will automatically generate accessible versions of your plots in your default browser. You can then interact with the accessible versions using keyboard shortcuts (refer to @tbl-shortcuts).

Check more examples in the [galleries](examples.qmd#sec-examples).

### Sample Bar Plot

```{python}
#| warning: false
#| fig-alt: Bar plot showing the average body mass of penguins by species

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Just import maidr package #<<
import maidr #<<


# Load the penguins dataset
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")

# Create a bar plot showing the average body mass of penguins by species
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))

# Assign the plot to a variable #<<
bar_plot = sns.barplot( #<<
    x="species", y="body_mass_g", data=penguins, errorbar="sd", palette="Blues_d"
)
plt.title("Average Body Mass of Penguins by Species")
plt.xlabel("Species")
plt.ylabel("Body Mass (g)")

# plt.show()

# Use maidr.show() to display your plot #<<
maidr.show(bar_plot) #<<
```
